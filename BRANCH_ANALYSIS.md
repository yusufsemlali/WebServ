## Evidence

### Commit Details
- **Commit SHA**: `43517545f04fd9e82253652964e86a1bb7974b9e`
- **Commit Message**: "New base code. non blocking"
- **Author**: CtrlSyn (anas.soulaii@gmail.com)
- **Date**: September 27, 2025 at 15:34:51 UTC
- **Changes**: 1,186 additions, 39 deletions across 15 files

### What Happened
1. **Main branch** currently points to commit `43517545` (Sept 27, 2025)
   - This is CtrlSyn's "New base code. non blocking" commit
   
2. **Anas branch** points to commit `504a3e95` (Sept 10, 2025)
   - This is an older commit: "Add WebServ capabilities with file upload and JSON handling"
   
3. **Timeline**:
   - Sept 11, 2025: PR #7 merged the anas branch into main (commit `5f721b1`)
   - Sept 27, 2025: CtrlSyn pushed directly to main branch instead of anas branch

### Expected Behavior
CtrlSyn should have:
1. Pushed the commit to the **anas** branch
2. Created a pull request to merge it into main
3. Had the changes reviewed before merging

### Actual Behavior
CtrlSyn pushed directly to the **main** branch, bypassing:
- The pull request process
- Code review
- The branch protection workflow

## Recommendation
To maintain proper Git workflow:
1. Reset main branch to commit `5f721b1` (the Sept 11 merge commit)
2. Cherry-pick commit `43517545` onto the anas branch
3. Create a new pull request from anas to main
4. Consider enabling branch protection rules on main to prevent direct pushes

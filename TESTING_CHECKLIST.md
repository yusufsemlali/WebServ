### 8. Error Handling

### 10. Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Can load complete websites with resources
- [ ] Handles concurrent requests (CSS, JS, images)

### 11. Stress Testing
- [ ] Handle 100+ simultaneous connections
- [ ] Handle rapid connect/disconnect
- [ ] Handle slow clients (slow send/recv)
- [ ] Memory doesn't leak under load
- [ ] Server remains available under stress
- [ ] No segfaults or crashes

### 12. Edge Cases

- [ ] Malformed requests
- [ ] Very long URLs
- [ ] Very long headers
- [ ] Missing required headers

- [ ] Client disconnects mid-response

## üéÅ Bonus Features (Optional)
- [ ] Cookies support
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Multiple CGI types
- [ ] Virtual hosts (Host header routing)

## üß™ Testing Tools Required
1. **Manual Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox
2. **Command-line**: curl, telnet, netcat (nc)
3. **Load Testing**: siege, ab (Apache Bench), or custom script
4. **Automated Testing**: Python/Shell scripts
5. **Comparison**: Test same scenarios with NGINX

## üìù Test Documentation
- Record all test results
- Document any deviations from NGINX behavior
- Note any known limitations
- Prepare demo scenarios for evaluation

## The Problem in Simple Terms

**What CtrlSyn did:**
1. Worked on new code ("New base code. non blocking")
2. Instead of: `git push origin anas`
3. He did: `git push origin main` (or was on main branch)

**Why it's wrong:**
- No pull request = no code review
- Bypassed team workflow
- Could break main branch without notice
- Other team members might not be aware of changes

**The fix:**
1. Move main back to where it was (5f721b1)
2. Put the new code on anas branch where it belongs
3. Create a proper PR for review

## Branch Protection Recommendation

After fixing, enable on main branch:
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Include administrators (no one can bypass)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

This will prevent future direct pushes to main!
